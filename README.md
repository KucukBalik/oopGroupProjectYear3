# Library Management System 
Our project is Springboot app with microservices which will allow users to register/login, borrow books and receive some kind of notifications.  

# Services 
Includes 4 services, Users services(login/register) , Books Service(for list of books, create etc...), Loans Service(To borrow books) and notifications Service(send notifications if due) and possibly a records service to keep track and log(I think)

# Tech
Java maven, Springboot, Swagger, Github. More Tech to be used in future. 

# How to use!
for now you can simply clone the repo, make sure to use java 25 cause seems to be conflicts with some of our dependencies for some group members. Ports will be assigned in application properties. Then you can run all services from intellij and use Swagger to test. Each week With new material we can add more tech like a Docker and databases and increase functionality.

We will update as we go!
